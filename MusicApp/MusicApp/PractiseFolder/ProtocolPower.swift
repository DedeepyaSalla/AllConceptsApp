/*
 Main approach while implementing protocok oriented programming is not just sit and think oh I need to declare protocol n use it everywhere --
 1.Just try to understand what is ur goal first and will that goal appear in rest of the app frequently
 eg:  you need to load vc with a storyboard id and also load it from a specific storybaord
 solutions:
 if you can use enums to declare names, then hardcoding can be avoided
